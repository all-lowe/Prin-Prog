Programmed in Scheme.

Given a word such as '(h e l l o) , a hashlist containing hash functions, and a dictionary.  This program will return if the word
is contained in the given dictionary.  If it is contained in the dictionary, it will return #t for true else #f for false.  

This code is simple, every word has a certain array of hash functions to use.  The code takes in a word and a set of hash functions
and creates a list of hash values.  If those hash values match the hash values in the dictionary, its a match, otherwise its not a 
match.  For every match it will report a 1 in another list called the bitvector list, otherwise 0 in the bitvector list.  

Once we have created the final bitvector list it may look somelike like '(0 0 0 1 0) or '(1 1 1 1 1).  The final spellchecker 
result should only return #t if every bit in the bitvector list contains a 1, otherwise it is false (#f).  

Note: Additionally, this code may produce false positives which means that mispelled words may be signaled as correct, but modifying
the size variable used for the division and multiplication hash functions can reduce the odds of false positives.
